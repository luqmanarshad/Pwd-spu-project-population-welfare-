PWD (Population Welfare Department) is a comprehensive management system developed using Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js. 
It automates population welfare services, streamlining processes like resource management, appointment scheduling, 
and case tracking. With Twilio integration for SMS alerts and Firebase for real-time updates, the system ensures efficient communication and timely service delivery.

The platform also incorporates role-based access control to manage permissions and data security, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. 
By utilizing MySQL for optimized data storage and leveraging APIs for third-party services, PWD enhances collaboration between departments, enabling data-driven decisions and improved public service outcomes.
